             My name is Ethan Justice I have lived in Romeoville Illinois my whole life. I love to go 
             travel the world and see new places. I really enjoy going scuba diving in the carribean. So 
            far my favorite spot to be is probably the bahamsa in Nassau. I am also a pretty huge gamer.
            I play a lot of video games when i'm not doing homeoworkI play a lot of first-person shooter
            games like Rainbow Six Siege and Call of Duty. But lately I have been playing a action role 
            playing game called Path Of Exile. Its super fun and has a lot of colorful explosions. Other
            than video games and school the only other thing I really do is train with and play with my 
            10 month old german shepherd named Ember. She is super awesome and loves to play with her ball.
            If I can figure out how to I will put a picture of her in my website. I am currently a Cyber-
            Security major hoping to do something related in the future. That's all I really know about as of now.
